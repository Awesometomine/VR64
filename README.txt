kinda rushed but hey it works
before using this you should know 3 key things:

1. this does not allow you to use core r64 mechanics while in vr e.g. diving, double jumping won't work.
All this does is tracks your vr movements and sends it to the r64 clients which sends it to the server (plus the other features)

2. the information between the 2 clients is sent through txt files which are written and read by each client

3. the client in r64 should use maximum render quality so that the other player models are captured smoothly

GUIDE:
1. move the VR64 folder into your synapse workspace folder
2. download roblox alt manager as you require 2 accounts on your end to track the other players movement
3. have 1 alt join r64 and the other join vr64 (using a priavte server is recommended)
vr64 = https://www.roblox.com/games/11517311012/R64-VR64 
r64 = https://www.roblox.com/games/1111083356/Robot-64
4. have your vr player join vr64
5. change currentPlayer.txt to the vr players username e.g. TrackingPlayer = "awsometomine"
6. execute "Record.lua" as the client in vr64 game
7. execute "Playback.lua" as the client in r64 game
8. your player in vr should now be able to interact with other players while in vr
